24/04/25 Python plugins - browse  button for filenames and checkboxes for boolean parameters,
	processing return values including addition of new geometries to ws.
	Creation of arrow array from xgeometry fields.
	Plugins for reading general xgeometry, setting ionic charges and mulpole moments calculation.
	
24/04/22
	Draft version of python plugins ready.
	The secret feature of "extended editor" now has special button on top of itemlist.
24/04/14 fix(rotation)
	After previous edition rotation became laggy. Fixed now.
	
24/04/02 Settings
	Settings dialog activated. Settings moved to "Edit" menu.
	Mouse settings tab now allows to tune mouse sensitivity for rotations, translations and
	mouse wheel step.
	
24/03/30 Manual edition of visible atomic radius from Object Inspector.
	
24/03/26 Properties of atoms with non-periodic table names
	Unpleasent feature of previous edition of qppcad was that if an atomic name was not element
	symbol of periodic table it did not appear in "Bonding" tab of Object Inspector and did not
	have any bonds. It also had ridiculous atomic radius.
	The new convention is: If atomic name starts with element symbol, and than have trailing
	digits of "_" letter with some additional letters, its properties are taken from
	periodic table. I.e. F1, F2, F_cls are fluorines, while Si4, Si_shl, Si_adbas and Si_631 are silicons.
	Separate color selection for different atomic names is available.
	TODO: Decide about radius/color/bonding of atoms whose names do not start from element symbol.
	TODO: Add the possibility to manually edit visible atomic radius (DONE)
	
24/03/25 Create arrow array
	New submenu "Create new.." added to main menu "Workspace" item. It has four items:
	"Geometry", "Symmetry group", "Graphic primitives" and "Arrow array". The first three
	are empty yet, but the last one now opens dialog window. It is possible to
	create arrow array as the difference between two arbitrary frames of current animation.
	TODO: Creation of arrow array from eXtended geometry fields.
	TODO: "Geometry", "Symmetry group", "Graphic primitives" items.
	TODO: Replace "+" button in Object Inspector with new menu.
	
24/03/20 Rotation fixed
	The atomic rotation style has been changed and became more smooth.
	Now for any mouse move one rotation axis and angle are determined first.
